## 📍 Project Overview  
AirSense India is a data-driven project focused on analyzing air pollution across Indian cities from **2015 to 2020**. It provides visual and statistical insights into air quality trends, comparing multiple pollutants and exploring their seasonal and regional variations.

---

## 💡 Motivation  
Air pollution is a critical concern in India, affecting millions of lives every year. With many cities ranked among the most polluted in the world, understanding long-term trends and their health implications is crucial. This project is driven by the need to:
- Raise awareness about pollution's health effects  
- Understand historical trends using data  
- Inform and influence policy decisions with evidence  
- Encourage citizen engagement through data storytelling  

---

## 🧩 Key Components  

### 📦 Data Collection
- Dataset includes air quality metrics from **multiple Indian cities**
- Major pollutants analyzed:  
  - `PM2.5`  
  - `PM10`  
  - `NO₂`  
  - `CO`  
  - `O₃` (Ozone)

### 🔍 Data Analysis
- Utilized Python for data preprocessing, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis  
- Applied libraries like `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn`  
- Conducted year-wise, city-wise, and pollutant-wise analysis  

### 📊 Visualization
- Created meaningful plots and visual summaries:
  - Line graphs (trends over time)  
  - Bar charts (comparisons across cities)  
  - Heatmaps (seasonal effects)  
  - Pie charts (pollutant contributions)

## 📊 Visualizations  

Our visual analysis includes:
- 📈 **Trend Lines** – Track pollution level changes over the years  
- 🗂️ **City Comparisons** – Identify the most and least polluted cities  
- 🧊 **Seasonal Analysis** – Understand seasonal peaks in pollution  
- 🧮 **Statistical Distributions** – Assess pollutant behavior and spread  

These visuals help transform raw data into insights that are intuitive and actionable.

## 📈 Insights & Findings  

- 🧪 **Winter is the Worst:** Pollution levels peak in winter across most Indian cities, likely due to inversion layers and increased emissions.  
- 🏙️ **Delhi, Kanpur & Varanasi** consistently rank among the most polluted.  
- 🫁 **Health Impact:** High levels of PM2.5 and PM10 are associated with respiratory issues and cardiovascular diseases.  
- 🎆 **Festivals & Harvesting:** Noticeable spikes around Diwali and crop-burning seasons.  
- 🧾 **Policy Implication:** The data supports enforcement of seasonal emission control policies.
