## Project Overview  
The project focuses on analyzing air quality data in India from the years 2015 to 2020. It aims to provide insights into the air pollution levels across various cities in India, highlighting trends, patterns, and potential health impacts.

## Motivation for the project 
Air pollution is a major environmental and health concern in India, affecting millions of people each year. Many cities suffer from consistently poor air quality, leading to serious health issues. This project is motivated by the need to analyze historical air quality data to identify trends, causes, and impacts. By extracting insights from real data, we aim to raise awareness, support policy decisions, and contribute to efforts aimed at improving air quality and public health.

## Key Components of the Project
- Data Collection  
• The dataset includes air quality measurements from multiple cities in India.  
• It contains various pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, and Ozone.  
- Data Analysis  
• The project utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.  
• It performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and trends of air quality over the years.  
- Visualization  
• The project includes visual representations of air quality data, such as line graphs and bar charts.  
• These visualizations help in identifying peak pollution periods and comparing air quality across different cities.  
- Insights and Findings  
• The analysis aims to uncover correlations between air quality and health issues.  
• It may also explore the impact of seasonal changes on air pollution levels.  

## Needs of our project
This project serves as a valuable resource for understanding air quality issues in India, providing insights that can inform policy decisions and public awareness regarding air pollution and its effects on health.
